The project seems to be working per the project description.  When testing, we were able to open multiple telnet connections to the server, and still receive back a response to our http_client.c program while the other connections were established.  The server is programmed to work specfically with the format of requests sent by the client program, for simplicity, although it could be modified in the future to support much more complex, verbose messaging.
